kubectl explain rc
kubectl explain rc --recursive // to see in more detail

how to know pod is under controller
kubectl describe <pod name>

kubectl delete rc <rc-name>

when we run by default we get some random label 
to delete label
ex:
kubectl label pod <pod-name> run-
assign new label: kubectl label pod <pod-name> team=dev

*** 
IF YOU WANT ONE POD NOT TO BE MANAGED BY REPLICATION CONTROLLER you can simply unset the lable or change the lable 
Now RC try to create new pod inorser to maintain desired state
*** by default if you remove rplication controller it will remove rplication controller along with pods
but you want to remove only replication controller but not pods then
kubectl delete rc --cascade=false <rc-name>


HOW ROLLING UPGRADE HAPPENSIN CAASE OF REPLICATION CONtROLLER
===============================================================
now controller will get created one by one each pod will get deleted in old RC 
once all new pods got created in new RC, the connection re-established again to new RC with some down time
