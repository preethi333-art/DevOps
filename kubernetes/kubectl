Kubernetes Objects:
Kubernetes objects are persistent entities of your kubernetes system,entites is nothing but it represent your state of the cluster

kubernetes object is "record of intent", once you create object,kubernetes will make sure the object exists.

Every Kubernetes object has a specification (spec) and it has object status,
The specification is all about what we want and it is regarded as desired state and the stauts is nothing
but the actual state of kubernetes

Every Kubernetes has a spec and the status

we specify object spec in the format of .yaml file (manifest file) and we the status of the kubernets object after we apply the spec


kubectl ---> API Server

kubectl ---> API server
file format ---> API Server

Kubernetes provides a lot of resources,,, kubectl api-resources --List of all the resources


Kubernetes API:
The core of the kubernetes control plane is the API server,this API -server exposes http API's that lets
enduser and different parts of your cluster ,external componetns communicate each others


kubernetes stores the serialized states of the objects by writing them to the etcd database


To express the desired state ,we would be creating the specification of the kubernetes resources
* pod
*container
*ephermel containers
* Replication Controllers
* Replica sets
* Deployments
* statefuset
* Daemon sets
* Job
* CronJob
* Horizontal pod Auto scaler

API groups and Versioning :

Kubernetes supports mulitple apiVersion ( Core Apiversion)
API groups make it easier to extend the kubernetes api.The API group is specified in the REST path and is in the form 
__apiVersion__ field of serialzied objects

There are several apigroups:

Core api group,Rest path /api/v1---> v1

Named groupd --> /api/$GROUP_NAME/$version

/api/batch/v1 ---> batch/v1

#### Kubectl

Kubectl is command line utlity for interacting and performing various operation on Kubernetes

Kubectl has 2 ways of managing the cluster
1. Imperative method--> we create object by executing the command,or kubectl commands
kubectl get pods
kubectl get nodes
kubectl apply -f hello-pod.yaml

2.Declartive method
.yaml ,apply ,delete

How kubectl communicates with kuberentes:

The API Servers manages communication in kubernetes ( for the developer it look like it a API gateway)

To achieve the communication,the API server implement RESTFULL API over http and https to perform
CRUD operations to populate and modify k8s API objects (pods,service,deployments)


kubectl is a commandline utiliry to interact or perform various operationds on k8s
kubectl has 2 ways of managing the cluster 
1. imperative method
2. Declarative method
IMPERATIVE METHOD
--------------------
we  create pod by executing commands or kubectl commands
kubectl get pods
kubectl apply -f hello.yml

DECLARATIVE METHOD
------------------

we create object by specifying desire state in the spec file Basically we create .yml file and we apply that yml
when we apply it will create the object for that or else it will create the object what ever desire state you want 

As soon as you run kubectl command basically you are actually using some kind of rest api call over the http and https 

api servet receives the restapi call and it does some kind of authentication and validation here 
whether he is actual user or not, he has authorization or not 
once all those authorization, authentication , validation is donr then the data will be return to the etcd database
* now basically this etcd what ever data returned finally it will try to retrive uit and send responses to the apiserver and finally
apiserver send bacl to the terminal.
IN API SERVER MAINLY WE HAVE 3
AUTHENTICATION
AUTHORIZATION
CONTROLLER

     when we run kubectl get pods controller wont come in to picture only if you are updating the object or modifying then controller 
will come in to the picture

kubectl config view  this will tell the user currently executing all the commands the user is k*s ADMIN here 
for more info go to---> .kube 
                         ls
                         cd config
this config file have all the info certifies who is the user, what kind of client

## whenever you execute command you have to check who is actually executing
this user data is already mentioned in this config file it means he is vailid user and allow him to execute
so whenever you do RESTAPI call here through command line it is doing authentication
