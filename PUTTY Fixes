Before loadong ppk from pem through PUTTY GEN
goto Key---> parameters for saving key files---> ppk file version choose 2---> OK ----> load

1) Create New Instance 
2) Stop Both Instance 
3) De-attach and Attach Main Instance EBS with Recovery Instance 
4) Start Recovery Instance and Mount New Attached Disk 
5) Copy and paste Recovery Instance.ssh/authorized_keys file content with Attached EBS .ssh/authorized_keys file

1.change SG of instance inbound --> ssh to anywhere
2. connect to ec2 from console no need pem
3. ssh-keygen -t rsa --> t will create in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/
4. 2 files generated id_rsa and id_rsa.pub private and public key
5. convert private to specific format using below command earlier it will be begin openssh Private ky
it will convert to begin and end RSG PK
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f id_rsa
6.cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
7. cat id_rsa and copy  paste in vscode  change CRLF to LF since we need unix format save as
pem file name newKey.pem
8. login using key
remen=member aws for us create pub and private key gives us prikey and keeps aws pub key in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
what we did here is manyally generating pub and pri using ssh-keygen and keeping .pem private key with us and giving pub to aws by pasting in authorized_keys
