sonarqube

says in this part we have code smell/bugs/vulerabilities
 
# Sonar-qube will use to check the below things
-> Code Quality Check
-> Code Coverage --> say in percentage How much Source code is tested by Unit test cases
                     atleast 80% tested
-> Code Quality Gate

# What is Code Quality Check
-> Code Quality Check means Checking the quality of code to find out these kind of issues
    -> Bugs(CODING WRONG)  --> It's Going to make the application in wrong way that's we called bug
    -> Code Smell(code working but create confusion)  --> Code is working but It
		is not written proper way it could cause issued in feature that section we called code smell
    -> Duplicate  --> Same has written mulitples times that section we called Duplicate
    -> Security Vulnerability  --> Security Vulnerability that refer to that section of code where having the security risk for sure
    -> Security Hotpots  --> Security Hotpots that refers to that section code right now which is not having any kind of issues but we have some indication we have some security issues. we have manually review the code to find out the issues.


# What is Code Coverage
-> How much Source code is tested by Unit test cases
Ex:- If you get 60% of code coverage it means when your Unit test case has tested only 600 lines of code out of 1000 lines.
        Then Code Coverage let us know you have to run some more test cases to cover the remaining lines. As well as it will let us know The code which we tested really it is needed or unless or junk code

sonarqube has compatible with all programming language  

sonarqube having 2 versions
Community version   -->  free limit on how many lines of code it can perform analysis
Developer version  ---> paid version

# What is Code Quality Gate
-> We have to setup the parameters based on our company requirments. It should be pass that certain criteria that's we called code quality gate
-> parametes are Code coverage 80%, Security 5%, Deplicates 0% 
       
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community

A Quality Profile  --> what kind of sourcode in which language it is written              
                       it has rules it will findout whre are bugs and code smells
					   if you want you can create your owm custom quality profiles
					   we can install from market place if you dont have installed
 Quality Gate  -->  we can set certain conditions ex  how much code coverage you want
sonarqube-scanner and eclipse temuran for jdk  --> plugins
install tools in global tool configurataion

we need to add jacoco in our pom
# What is the difference between Quality Profile and Quality Gate
-> A Quality Profile in SonarQube defines the set of rules for analyzing code quality, 
-> while a Quality Gate defines the criteria that a project must meet to pass a quality check.


# Types of Sonar version
-> Community Edition   --> We can perform analysis on main branch
-> Developer Edition   --> We can perform analysis on multiple branches
-> Enterprice Edition  --> We can perform analysis on multiple branches
