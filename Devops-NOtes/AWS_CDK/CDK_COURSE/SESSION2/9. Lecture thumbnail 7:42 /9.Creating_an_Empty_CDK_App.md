Great! That lecture was all about setting up a **clean CDK Python application** from scratch ‚Äî now, *you* will be writing CDK code yourself instead of using prebuilt examples.

Let me break it down clearly into key points and explain anything you might still be unclear about.

---

## üìå Summary: What Did You Learn in This Lecture?

### üîß 1. **Initialize a New CDK App**

* Created a folder named `my_sample_app`
* Opened it in VS Code
* Ran:

  ```bash
  cdk init app -l python
  ```

  This initializes a CDK Python app using the **default "app" template**

---

### üêç 2. **Python Environment Setup**

* Activated virtual environment:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
* Upgraded pip (best practice):

  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
* Installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### üìÇ 3. **Project Structure**

| File/Folder              | Purpose                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.py`                 | The main entry point that creates the CDK stack                  |
| `my_sample_app/`         | Folder where your actual stack class lives                       |
| `my_sample_app_stack.py` | Contains the `MySampleAppStack` class where you define resources |
| `.venv/`                 | Virtual environment (all Python libs live here)                  |
| `cdk.json`               | Config for CDK (e.g., which command to run for synthesis)        |
| `requirements.txt`       | App dependencies like CDK libraries                              |
| `requirements-dev.txt`   | Dev/test-only packages like `pytest`                             |
| `tests/`                 | Folder for infrastructure unit tests                             |

### üèóÔ∏è 4. **How CDK Code is Structured**

* `app.py` creates the CDK app and instantiates a stack:

  ```python
  app = cdk.App()
  MySampleAppStack(app, "MySampleAppStack")
  app.synth()
  ```

* `my_sample_app_stack.py` defines the actual AWS resources like S3, Lambda, etc.:

  ```python
  class MySampleAppStack(Stack):
      def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs):
          super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)
          # Define your resources here
  ```

---

### üßπ 5. **Cleaned Up Sample Code**

* Removed default SQS queue sample
* Deleted unused imports (`aws_sqs`, `Duration`)
* Now you're ready to add your own AWS resources (constructs)

---

## ü§î So What Happens Next?

Now you‚Äôre ready to start **defining AWS resources** (constructs) inside your stack file using L1, L2, or L3 constructs ‚Äî just like we discussed before.

---

## ‚úÖ Want to Try It Out?

Here‚Äôs a simple **first L2 example** to try in your cleaned `my_sample_app_stack.py`:

### ‚ûï Add an S3 Bucket (L2 Construct)

```python
from aws_cdk import aws_s3 as s3

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyFirstBucket",
    versioned=True,
    removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
)
```

This will create a versioned S3 bucket and delete it when the stack is destroyed (good for dev/test).

Would you like help adding this to your stack and deploying it with `cdk deploy`? Or want a walkthrough for your **first Lambda function**?
