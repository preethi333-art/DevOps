Here‚Äôs a **concise summary** of the lecture on AWS CDK L1 Constructs and how to use them, particularly focusing on creating a **VPC using L1 constructs** in Python:

---

### üîπ What Are CDK Constructs?

* **Constructs** are the **basic building blocks** of CDK apps.
* Even the **App** and **Stack** are constructs (special types).
* Constructs can represent **individual AWS resources** or a group (solution).

---
thewe are 3 levels of constructs L1, L2, and L3. 
### üîπ Construct Levels

1. **L1 (Low-level):**

   * Map **1:1 with CloudFormation** resources.
   * Names start with **`Cfn`** (e.g., `CfnVPC`).
   * Require **detailed knowledge** of each AWS resource.
   * Ideal for users familiar with CloudFormation.
   * you can switch to CDK using only L1 constructs to replace JSON or YAML templates with code in your favorite

programming language, such as Python.

2. **L2 (Higher-level):**

   * Provide sensible defaults and best practices.
   * Easier to use; abstract many details.

3. **L3 (Patterns):**

   * Composed of multiple L2 constructs as **pre-configured solutions**.

---

### üîπ Example Architecture (using L1 constructs)

* Create a **VPC** with:

  * **2 Availability Zones**
  * Each zone has:

    * **1 Public subnet**
    * **1 Private (isolated) subnet**
  * Attach an **Internet Gateway** to the VPC
  * Define routes to make public subnets accessible
  * **No NAT Gateway** (to stay within Free Tier)

---

### üîπ Writing the CDK Code

* CDK code typically goes into the **`__init__`** method of your stack class.

* To define a VPC using an L1 construct:

  * Use the **`aws_cdk.aws_ec2`** module.
  * Import with:

    ```python
    import aws_cdk.aws_ec2 as ec2
    ```

* L1 Construct for VPC is:

  ```python
  ec2.CfnVPC
  ```

---

### üîπ Using the CDK Construct Library Reference

* Access the reference from the lecture resources.
* Navigate via:

  * **Service (e.g., EC2)**
  * Scroll to **CloudFormation Resources** section
  * Look for constructs that start with **`Cfn`**

---

### üîπ Construct Syntax Overview

To instantiate an L1 construct like `CfnVPC`, use:

```python
from aws_cdk import aws_ec2 as ec2
from aws_cdk import core  # or aws_cdk as cdk in newer versions

vpc = ec2.CfnVPC(
    self,
    "MyVpc",
    cidr_block="10.0.0.0/16",
    enable_dns_support=True,
    enable_dns_hostnames=True,
    tags=[core.CfnTag(key="Name", value="MyVpc")]  # Correct tag format
)

internet_gateway = ec2.CfnInternetGateway(self, "InternetGateway")

ec2.CfnVPCGatewayAttachment(
    self,
    "IGWAttachment",
    vpc_id=vpc.attr_vpc_id,
    internet_gateway_id=internet_gateway.attr_internet_gateway_id
)

```

* You must **know the properties** of the resource (same as CloudFormation).
* For full property list, use the **CloudFormation reference link** provided in the construct‚Äôs CDK reference.

---

### üîπ Summary Takeaways

* **L1 constructs** give **full control** but require **deep resource knowledge**.
* Use **construct library reference** to identify and configure resources.
* CDK lets you write **infrastructure as code** in your preferred language, like Python.
* Learning to use **L1 constructs** prepares you to understand and eventually use **L2 and L3** more effectively.

Certainly! Here's a natural continuation of the lecture summary, picking up from where the previous section ended:

---

üß† 1. CDK L1 Constructs Mirror CloudFormation
You are guided to scroll to the "Syntax" section of the AWS CDK reference documentation.

It is explained that:

CDK L1 constructs directly map to CloudFormation resources.

Properties like CidrBlock become cidr_block (i.e., PascalCase ‚Üí snake_case), which is the Pythonic convention.

üß± 2. Creating the VPC (L1 Construct)
The construct ec2.CfnVPC is used to define a VPC manually.

Arguments passed:

self: Represents the current stack object (analogous to this in JavaScript).

Logical ID: 'MyVpc' (follows CloudFormation PascalCase naming).

Keyword arguments:

cidr_block='10.0.0.0/16'

enable_dns_hostnames=True

enable_dns_support=True

Python indentation is emphasized: it must be at the same indentation level as the super() call inside __init__.

üåê 3. Internet Gateway Creation
Created using ec2.CfnInternetGateway.

Passed:

self

Logical ID: 'InternetGateway'

This construct does not require any properties.

üîó 4. Attach Internet Gateway to VPC
Done via ec2.CfnVPCGatewayAttachment.

Passed:

self

Logical ID: 'IgwAttachment'

Properties:

vpc_id=my_vpc.attr_vpc_id

internet_gateway_id=internet_gateway.attr_internet_gateway_id

üîÑ 5. Understanding attr_ Attributes
CDK L1 constructs provide instance attributes for CloudFormation return values.

For example:

attr_vpc_id maps to Fn::GetAtt ‚Üí VpcId in CloudFormation.

These attr_* attributes are auto-generated for most returned values.

If a particular attribute is not available, you can use:

python
Copy code
my_vpc.get_att("VpcId")
Equivalent to Fn::GetAtt.

üß© 6. Synthesizing and Deploying
Run:

cdk synth ‚Äì Generates the CloudFormation template.

cdk deploy ‚Äì Deploys it to AWS.

CDK automatically creates a cdk.out folder and CloudFormation JSON template.

Verified deployment using:

CDK Explorer in VS Code (from AWS Toolkit extension).

CloudFormation Console.

üìâ 7. Observations Post Deployment
The deployment is successful: the stack includes:

The VPC

The Internet Gateway

The Gateway Attachment

But: No subnets yet!

This is highlighted visually using the Resource Map in the AWS Console.

Sets up the next lecture: defining subnets, routing, and associations.

‚úÖ Summary of New Concepts Introduced
Concept	Details
Pythonified CDK Syntax	Snake_case for properties, unlike PascalCase in raw CloudFormation
L1 Construct Usage	CfnVPC, CfnInternetGateway, CfnVPCGatewayAttachment
Using attr_* Attributes	Access return values from resources like attr_vpc_id, attr_internet_gateway_id
get_att() Fallback	Used when attr_* attributes are missing
Stack Deployment Steps	cdk synth ‚Üí verify JSON ‚Üí cdk deploy ‚Üí validate via console
CDK Explorer Tool	Visualizes stacks and resources in VS Code
Next Steps Teased	Will add subnets, route tables, and internet routing later
