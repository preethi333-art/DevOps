Correct ✅

**L3 constructs (CDK Patterns)** like `aws-lambda-dynamodb` **are not included** in the core AWS CDK libraries (`aws-cdk-lib`). Instead, they are:

---

### 📦 **Published as Separate Packages**

* Each L3 construct (pattern) is a separate **library** you must **install explicitly**.
* These are maintained by **AWS Solutions Constructs** or **3rd-party authors**.

---

### 🔧 **Example (Python)**

If you want to use the [`LambdaToDynamoDB`](https://constructs.dev/packages/@aws-solutions-constructs/aws-lambda-dynamodb) construct:

#### 1. 📥 **Install the separate library**

```bash
pip install aws-solutions-constructs.aws-lambda-dynamodb
```

#### 2. 📦 **Import it in your CDK app**

```python
from aws_solutions_constructs.aws_lambda_dynamodb import LambdaToDynamoDB
```

### 📁 CDK Construct Library Breakdown

| Construct Level   | Included in `aws-cdk-lib`? | Installed Separately? | Example                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| L1                | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                  | `CfnTable`, `CfnFunction`            |
| L2                | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                  | `lambda.Function`, `dynamodb.Table`  |
| **L3 (Patterns)** | ❌ **No**                   | ✅ **Yes**             | `LambdaToDynamoDB`, `ApiGatewayToS3` |

### 📌 Why Separate?

* Keeps the **core CDK small and clean**.
* Encourages **modular reuse**.
* Allows **community-contributed** and **solution-specific** constructs to evolve independently.
