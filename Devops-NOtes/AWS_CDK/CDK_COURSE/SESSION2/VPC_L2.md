Here’s a **final summary of everything we've discussed** about using **L1 and L2 constructs in AWS CDK**, especially focusing on the **VPC example** — explained in a clear, structured, beginner-friendly way:

## 🧱 CDK Constructs: L1 vs L2

| Feature                   | L1 Construct (`CfnVPC`)                               | L2 Construct (`Vpc`)                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level                     | Low-level (close to CloudFormation)                   | High-level (abstracted, opinionated)                                  |
| Naming                    | Starts with `Cfn` prefix                              | No `Cfn` prefix                                                       |
| Mapping                   | Direct 1:1 mapping with CloudFormation                | Composed of multiple L1 constructs internally                         |
| Defaults & Abstractions   | No defaults; you must configure everything manually   | Provides sensible AWS best-practice defaults (e.g., subnets, routing) |
| Flexibility vs Simplicity | Very flexible, more complex                           | Simpler to use, less detailed control unless overridden               |
| Required Knowledge        | You must understand CloudFormation resources in depth | You can get started with minimal AWS internals knowledge              |
| Extra Utilities           | None                                                  | Includes helper methods (e.g., `add_gateway_endpoint()`)              |

## 🏗️ VPC Example using L2 Construct

### ✨ Goal:

Create a VPC with:

* 2 Availability Zones (AZs)
* 2 **public subnets**
* 2 **isolated subnets** (no NAT gateways)

### 🧾 L2 Code in Python:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)
from constructs import Construct

class MyVpcStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        my_vpc = ec2.Vpc(
            self, 
            "MyVpc",
            nat_gateways=0  # disables NAT gateways → isolated subnets
        )
```

---

## 🔍 What This Code Does Internally

Without specifying anything else:

* Creates **2 public subnets** (one per AZ)
* Creates **2 private subnets**, but since `nat_gateways=0`, they become **isolated**
* Assigns **CIDR ranges** automatically by dividing the default `10.0.0.0/16` block
* Adds **Internet Gateway** for public subnets
* No NAT gateways = no outbound internet for private subnets

## 🧰 Key Parameters in L2 `Vpc` Construct

| Parameter              | Purpose                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nat_gateways=0`       | Prevents creation of NAT gateways (makes private subnets *isolated*)                |
| `max_azs=2`            | (Optional) Number of availability zones to span                                     |
| `ip_addresses`         | Use instead of deprecated `cidr` to assign IP range (e.g., `IpAddresses.cidr(...)`) |
| `subnet_configuration` | For custom control over subnets (e.g., names, types, CIDRs)                         |

## 📘 Documentation Navigation Tips

* Visit: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/)
* Go to **`aws_ec2`** package
* Under **"Constructs"** section, find `Vpc` (L2) – not `CfnVPC` (L1)
* Use the **Python tab** for syntax
* Read sub-sections like:

  * **Subnet Types**
  * **Availability Zones**
  * **NAT Gateway behavior**
  * **Deprecated Parameters**

## 🏁 Deployment Flow (Recap)

### 🔧 Local Setup

* Define CDK app and stack
* Use L2 `Vpc` construct as shown

### 📦 Deployment Steps

```bash
cdk synth   # Optional: See raw CloudFormation output
cdk diff    # Optional: See what will change (change set preview)
cdk deploy  # Deploys the stack, prompts for confirmation
```

### 🔐 Why Permission Prompt?

Because the L2 `Vpc` construct includes:

* A **custom resource** backed by a **Lambda function**
* This Lambda modifies the **default security group** to restrict access
* Therefore, CDK prompts for IAM permission approval at deploy

---

## 🧠 Bonus: CloudFormation Change Set in CDK

When you run `cdk deploy`, it:

1. Synthesizes your template
2. Creates a **CloudFormation Change Set**:

   * Lists resources to be created, updated, or deleted
   * Shows what properties are changing
3. Asks for confirmation before applying it

You can also inspect change sets in:
**AWS Console → CloudFormation → Your Stack → Change Sets**

---

## ✅ Final Takeaways

* **L2 constructs** = easier, smarter defaults, great for most use cases
* You can still drop to **L1** if you need detailed customization
* Always refer to **CDK Docs** to understand what’s auto-created
* Avoid deprecated parameters like `cidr`; use `ip_addresses`
* Control behavior like NAT gateways or AZ count via constructor parameters
