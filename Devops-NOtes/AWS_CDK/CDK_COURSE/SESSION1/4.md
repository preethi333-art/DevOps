Session1 - 4
==============
CDK Supported Programming Languages
Python - v3.6 or later
TS-> v3.8 or later
JS-> available with  Nodes.js
JAVA --> 1.8 or later
.Net Core v3.1 or later

Python executables-> refers to the specific binary file that allows you to run Python applications on various operating systems.
================
Windows-python
macOS - python3 
Linux - python3 

We also need python package manager pip to install CDK library and other required packages
to check pip version
pip --version --> in windows
pip3 --version --> macos

To run main method of pic package available as a Python Module
To run pip as a python module
python/python3 -m pip --version
this displays same version as pip3 on my computer or pip if you are on windows
this may not be a latest pip version available, because pip is managed as a separate package from your Python installation. So, let‚Äôs try upgrading it
to ensure we have the latest 'pip' version.
Let‚Äôs run 'pip' as a Python module as before

python/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip --version


Practicle
=========
mkdir mycdk_app
cdk init --> CDK to initialize your application folder
'cdk init' command. This command uses application templates provided by CDK to initialize your application folder to simplify your start. But please don‚Äôt confuse these templates with CloudFormation templates. They are just for initializing new CDK apps. The 'cdk init' command gets the name of the template you will use to initialize your CDK app as the first input.


$ cdk init
Available templates:
* app: Template for a CDK Application
   ‚îî‚îÄ cdk init app --language=[csharp|fsharp|go|java|javascript|python|typescript]
* lib: Template for a CDK Construct Library
   ‚îî‚îÄ cdk init lib --language=typescript
* sample-app: Example CDK Application with some constructs  
   ‚îî‚îÄ cdk init sample-app --language=[csharp|fsharp|go|java|javascript|python|typescript]

===============================================

If you run it without inputs or options like this, it lists the application template choices available. The first one is the 'app' template, which creates an empty CDK app with no constructs. We will use the 'app' template in the following sections. 
The second option is the 'lib' template, which helps you initialize a CDK app that will be published as a custom construct to the Construct Hub.
And the last one is the 'sample-app' template, which creates a sample CDK application with some simple constructs defined.

lets use sample-app
cdk init sample-app --language=python

1).venv
=====
 'cdk init' command creates a Python virtual environment to isolate your application‚Äôs Python version from your operating system to avoid any version conflicts

cdk init app --language python


1. **You run:**

```bash
cdk init app --language python
```

2. **It creates a folder like this:**

```
my-cdk-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_cdk_app/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_cdk_app_stack.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/   ‚Üê This is the virtual environment
```

3. Inside `.venv/`:

   * There's a **copy of Python** just for this project.
   * You install packages like AWS CDK libraries using `pip install` **inside this environment**.

4. **You activate it:**

On Mac/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. **Then install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now all packages go **only inside this project**, not globally.

However, it doesn‚Äôt copy the pip binary from the global installation. It uses the 'ensurepip' package instead. So, it may not be the latest pip version in your virtual Python environment, even if you upgraded it globally on your computer. 

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
### ‚úÖ Benefit

If you later create another CDK app, it can have a **different Python version or packages** ‚Äî no conflict at all.

2) FOLDER SAME NAME AS CDK app
Absolutely! Let's take a closer look at the internal structure of the `my_cdk_app/` folder, which is created when you run:

```bash
cdk init app --language python
```

---

### üìÅ Folder: `my_cdk_app/`

This is a **Python package** (i.e., a folder with Python code and usually an `__init__.py` file). It typically contains your CDK **stack definitions**.

---

### üß± Example Structure:

```
my_cdk_app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_cdk_app_stack.py
```

 üìÑ `__init__.py`

* Marks this folder as a Python package.
* It can be empty, or you can use it to define what gets imported when the package is used.

 üìÑ `my_cdk_app_stack.py`

* This is where you **define your AWS resources** using AWS CDK.
* It typically contains a class like:

```python
from aws_cdk import Stack
from constructs import Construct

class MyCdkAppStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # Define AWS resources here, e.g.:
        # s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
```

---

### üîÑ Connected to `app.py`

In the root directory, `app.py` will **import the stack** like this:

```python
from my_cdk_app.my_cdk_app_stack import MyCdkAppStack
```

And then **instantiate it**:

```python
MyCdkAppStack(app, "MyCdkAppStack")
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* `my_cdk_app/` is the **Python module** for your CDK app.
* It contains all **infrastructure code** (stacks, constructs, etc.).
* You can create more files (e.g., `network_stack.py`, `database_stack.py`) as your project grows.

A cdk Application can have multiple stacks for the CloudFormation stacks deployed. 

 it imports the 'constructs' and 'aws_cdk' libraries. These are the official CDK libraries used to define your CDK components, which we will also install into our virtual Python environment in a minute. Then, there is a Python class definition for our first CDK stack in PascalCase as a convention. And it has a standard Python 'init' method to initialize the objects from this class. Again, if you remember, a CDK stack is where you
define your CDK constructs, which also correspond to one or more AWS resources deployed. And you place them in the 'init' method. So, whenever you instantiate a stack object from this class,
it will contain the constructs defined here.

3)The 'tests' folder

is a Python package encapsulating all testing-related packages

and modules. It has a sub-folder and package for unit tests

with a Python module containing sample tests for our first stack.

4)'app.py' file,

the main of our CDK app.

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import aws_cdk as cdk
from my_cdk_app.my_cdk_app_stack import MyCdkAppStack

app = cdk.App()

MyCdkAppStack(app, "MyCdkAppStack")

app.synth()
| Line                                                    | What It Does                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#!/usr/bin/env python3`                                | Tells the OS to use Python 3 to run the script (optional but common). |
| `import aws_cdk as cdk`                                 | Imports the core AWS CDK module.                                      |
| `from my_cdk_app.my_cdk_app_stack import MyCdkAppStack` | Imports your stack class from the app folder.                         |
| `app = cdk.App()`                                       | Creates a CDK application object ‚Äî acts as the root for the stack(s). |
| `MyCdkAppStack(app, "MyCdkAppStack")`                   | Instantiates your stack and adds it to the app.                       |
| `app.synth()`                                           | Synthesizes a CloudFormation template (CDK ‚Üí YAML).                   |


'requirement' files contain the Python library dependencies for this app.

The 'requirements-dev' text file is specific to development environments, which only contains the 'pytest' library by default, the Python library for testing. 
And the 'requirements.txt' file contains the dependencies for all environments, including production.
 And the last file, 'source.bat', is a Windows batch file used to activate the Python virtual environment on Windows. So, this is the project structure. 
However, our CDK app is still not ready. To work with a CDK application, you must install the dependencies first.
