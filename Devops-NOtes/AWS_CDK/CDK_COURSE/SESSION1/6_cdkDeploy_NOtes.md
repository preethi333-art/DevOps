**AWS CDK Deployment Explained: Easy Notes + Visual Guide**

---

### 🔄 Quick Recap: CDK App Lifecycle

1. **You write CDK code** (in `app.py` and stack files).
2. **CDK synthesizes** the code to a CloudFormation template using `cdk synth`.
3. **CDK deploys** the template using `cdk deploy`.

---

### 📚 What Happens During `cdk deploy`

* **Step 1:** Synthesizes your CDK code into a CloudFormation template.
* **Step 2:** CDK uploads deployment artifacts (e.g., Lambda zip files if needed).
* **Step 3:** It creates or updates the CloudFormation stack.
* **Step 4:** AWS provisions the actual AWS resources.

> **You don't need to run `cdk synth` before `cdk deploy`.** It is done automatically.

### 🔹 Sample CDK App Structure

```text
my_first_cdk_app/
├── app.py                   # CDK app entry point
├── my_first_cdk_app_stack.py  # Stack logic
└── cdk.json                 # Configuration file
```

---

### 🏛️ What's Inside `my_first_cdk_app_stack.py`

This defines the actual AWS infrastructure:

```python
class MyFirstCdkAppStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        queue = sqs.Queue(self, "MyFirstCdkAppQueue")
        topic = sns.Topic(self, "MyFirstCdkAppTopic")

        topic.add_subscription(subscriptions.SqsSubscription(queue))
```

This creates:

* An **SQS queue**
* An **SNS topic**
* **Subscribes** the queue to the topic (using `add_subscription()`)

---

### 🧵 Resources Created Automatically

You write **only 3 lines**, but CDK creates:

* `AWS::SQS::Queue`
* `AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy`
* `AWS::SNS::Topic`
* `AWS::SNS::Subscription`

---

### 🚀 Deploying with `cdk deploy`

```bash
cdk deploy
```

* Prompts for IAM permissions (e.g., SNS -> SQS)
* Shows deployment progress in the terminal
* Creates stack in **CloudFormation**

If you have **multiple stacks**, run:

```bash
cdk deploy my-first-cdk-app another-stack-name
```

or deploy all at once:

```bash
cdk deploy --all
```

---

### 📊 CDK Constructs Tree View (in CloudFormation Console)

Instead of a flat resource list, CDK groups them in a **Tree View**:

```
my-first-cdk-app (stack)
├── MyFirstCdkAppQueue
│   ├── AWS::SQS::Queue
│   ├── AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy
│   └── AWS::SNS::Subscription
└── MyFirstCdkAppTopic
    └── AWS::SNS::Topic
```

This helps you see:

* Which CDK construct created which AWS resource
* Extra resources CDK generated for you

---

### 🔐 IAM Permissions Prompt

When CDK deploys something with permissions (like SNS to SQS), it prompts:

```bash
Do you wish to deploy these changes (y/n)?
```

Type `y` and hit Enter to continue.

---

### 🌐 Post-Deployment:

* Visit **CloudFormation Console**
* See resources under the deployed stack (`my-first-cdk-app`)
* Switch between **Tree View** (CDK style) and **Flat View** (standard CFN)
* Check SQS Console ✅ Queue created
* Check SNS Console ✅ Topic + Subscription created

### 🎉 Key Takeaways

* Use `cdk deploy` to both synthesize and deploy
* CDK simplifies complex resource relationships (e.g., SNS -> SQS)
* CloudFormation Console helps visualize what CDK created
* Minimal code = Many underlying resources
* Avoid manual resource wiring
