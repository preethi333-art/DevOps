Here's a **simple, clear, and visual-style note** for this lecture on how to **destroy/delete a stack in AWS CDK**, suitable for revision and understanding:

## 🧨 Destroying a CDK Stack (Lecture Summary)

---

### 🛠️ Why Destroy a Stack?

* After deploying sample resources (SQS, SNS), we don’t need them anymore.
* Destroying stacks **cleans up unused AWS resources** to avoid unnecessary charges.

---

### 📍 Two Ways to Delete a Stack:

#### 1. **Using AWS CloudFormation Console**

* Go to CloudFormation.
* Select the stack (e.g., `my-first-cdk-app`).
* Click **Delete**.
* ⚠️ Don't delete the `CDKToolkit` stack — it’s needed for bootstrapping!

#### 2. **Using CDK Toolkit (Recommended)**

```bash
cdk destroy
```

* You can specify stack names if you have more than one:

  ```bash
  cdk destroy my-first-cdk-app another-stack
  ```
* Confirms with "Are you sure?" prompt → Type `y` to proceed.

---

### 📁 Before Running `cdk destroy`

* Ensure your Python virtual environment (`.venv`) is **activated**.

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  # or on Windows
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### ⚙️ Behind the Scenes (Lifecycle)

| Step                       | Description                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 `cdk destroy` starts    | Finds deployed stacks.                          |
| 🗑️ Prompts confirmation   | Prevents accidental deletions.                  |
| 🧹 Deletes stack resources | Sub-resources also removed (`DELETE_COMPLETE`). |
| ✅ Verifies deletion        | CloudFormation & Consoles confirm deletion.     |

---

### 🔍 Where to Check Deletion Status

* **CloudFormation Console**

  * Resources tab → Tree View & Flat View
  * Events tab → Logs deletion process
  * Stack info → Shows `DELETE_COMPLETE`

* **SNS Console**

  * No topic should exist after deletion

* **SQS Console**

  * No queue should exist after deletion

### 🎁 Bonus: CDK is Smarter than Raw CloudFormation!

#### S3 Deletion Example:

| Task                 | Raw CloudFormation               | CDK                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Delete S3 with files | ❌ Needs Lambda or DeletionPolicy | ✅ Just set `auto_delete_objects=True` |
| Complexity           | High                             | Low                                   |

**CDK simplifies** even advanced use cases like emptying buckets by default!

### 📌 Visual Summary

```plaintext
CDK Stack
   |
   └── Resources (SNS, SQS, etc.)
         |
         └── Sub-resources (Policy, Subscription)

⬇️

cdk destroy

⬇️

🗑️ All Resources → DELETE_COMPLETE
📭 SNS Topic → Gone
📦 SQS Queue → Gone
🧾 CloudFormation → Stack removed
```

---

### 💬 Key Commands

```bash
cdk destroy             # Destroys the single stack (if only one)
cdk destroy stack1 stack2  # Destroys specified stacks
```
