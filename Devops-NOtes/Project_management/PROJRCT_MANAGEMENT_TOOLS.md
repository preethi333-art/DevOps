## **1. Agile Methodology**

### **What is Agile?**
- A methodology that breaks large projects into smaller, manageable chunks (sprints).
- **Traditional Waterfall vs. Agile:**
  - **Waterfall:** Build entire feature in one go (3-5 months), then deliver to QA.
  - **Agile:** Break features into parts, deliver every 2-3 weeks for testing.

### **Why Agile Matters:**
- 90% of organizations use Agile methodology.
- Enables continuous feedback and iteration.
- Reduces risk and improves quality through early testing.
- **Key Terms:** Sprint, Sprint Planning, Sprint Retrospective, Backlog Grooming.

### **Learning Resources:**
- Start with Wikipedia for Agile concepts.
- Each organization implements Agile differently (2-week vs 3-week sprints, etc.).

### **What is Jira?**
- Platform for implementing Agile project management.
- Centralized tool for tracking work across the organization.

- Integrates with monitoring systems to automatically create incidents.
- Assigns tickets based on priority and team ownership.
- Example: Memory leak alert → Incident created → Assigned to support team → Resolution tracked.

### **Change Management:**
- Process for making changes to production systems.
- Requires approval workflow and coordination between teams.
