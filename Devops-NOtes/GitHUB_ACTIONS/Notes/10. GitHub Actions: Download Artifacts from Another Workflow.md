Here are the **structured and complete notes** for the GitHub Actions tutorial on **downloading artifacts from another workflow run**, including use cases, configuration, and common pitfalls:

---

## üìò GitHub Actions: Download Artifacts from Another Workflow

---

### ‚úÖ Use Case

Split your pipeline into **separate workflows**:

* One workflow for **build**
* Another for **deployment**
* Pass artifacts (e.g., compiled Angular app) from the build workflow to the deploy workflow

---

## üß± Workflow Separation

### üî® 1. **Build Workflow**: `build-angular.yml`

```yaml
name: Build Angular App

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-angular:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-artifact
          path: dist/
```

---

### üöÄ 2. **Deploy Workflow**: `deploy-angular.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy Angular App

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger for demo

jobs:
  deploy-angular:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifact from another workflow run
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-artifact
          path: artifact/
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          run-id: <PASTE_BUILD_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID_HERE>

      - name: List downloaded files
        run: ls -R artifact
```

## üß© Explanation of Key Inputs

| Input          | Required                           | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`         | ‚úÖ Yes                              | Name of the artifact (must match uploaded name)      |
| `path`         | ‚úÖ Yes                              | Local directory to place downloaded files            |
| `run-id`       | ‚úÖ Yes                              | Unique ID of the workflow run to fetch artifact from |
| `github-token` | ‚úÖ Yes                              | GitHub token to authorize access to another workflow |
| `repository`   | ‚úÖ If downloading from another repo | Format: `owner/repo`                                 |

---

### üîç Where to Get `run-id`

1. Go to the **build workflow run** (e.g., `build-angular.yml` run)
2. In the **URL or summary**, find the **Run ID**

   * Example: `https://github.com/user/repo/actions/runs/9603` ‚Üí Run ID = `9603`
3. Paste that ID into the `run-id:` field in `deploy-angular.yml`

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Output

* Artifact (e.g., `dist/`) is downloaded and extracted into `artifact/`
* You can verify using:

```yaml
- run: ls -R artifact
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Errors & Fixes

| Error Message               | Fix                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `artifact not found`        | Ensure artifact name is correct and `run-id` points to a run that uploaded it         |
| `missing github-token`      | Add `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`                                       |
| `repository not found`      | Make sure `repository:` is correct format or use `${{ github.repository }}`           |
| Accessing from another repo | Use **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with appropriate scopes instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN` |

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Feature                       | Details                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upload from build job         | Use `actions/upload-artifact@v4`                                 |
| Download in separate workflow | Use `actions/download-artifact@v4` with `run-id`, `github-token` |
| Cross-repo support            | Requires setting `repository:` and custom token                  |
| Run ID                        | Unique per workflow run                                          |

Let me know if you‚Äôd like:

* A script to auto-fetch `run-id` via the GitHub API
* Export to PDF or Markdown
* Combine both workflows into one CI/CD flow

Happy to help!
