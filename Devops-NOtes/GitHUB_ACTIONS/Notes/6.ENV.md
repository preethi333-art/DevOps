Here are the **comprehensive notes** on **Environment Variables in GitHub Actions**, based on the tutorial:

---

## üìò GitHub Actions: Environment Variables

---

### ‚úÖ What are Environment Variables?

* **Key-value pairs** used to store configuration or reusable data.
* Help avoid hardcoding values into workflow scripts.
* Accessible at **workflow**, **job**, or **step** levels.

---

## üîë Scope Levels of Environment Variables

| Level        | Defined Under          | Accessible In                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Workflow** | Top-level `env:`       | All jobs and steps in the workflow |
| **Job**      | Inside a `job > env:`  | All steps within that specific job |
| **Step**     | Inside a `step > env:` | Only that specific step            |

---

## üß± Sample Workflow: `.github/workflows/env-vars.yml`

```yaml
name: Env Vars Demo

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

env:  # üîπ Workflow-level env variable
  CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro

jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Greetings
        run: echo "Hello ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"

      - name: Get Comments
        run: echo "Get comments on ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"
```

---

### üí° Accessing Environment Variables

| Context               | Syntax                       | Example                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Workflow YAML**     | `${{ env.VAR_NAME }}`        | `${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}` |
| **Inside Bash**       | `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` | `echo $CHANNEL_NAME`      |
| **Inside PowerShell** | `$env:VAR_NAME`              | `echo $env:CHANNEL_NAME`  |

---

## üîÅ Using Env Variables in Multiple Jobs

```yaml
env:
  CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro

jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"

  job-two:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello from ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"
```

‚úÖ Workflow-level `env` is accessible across all jobs.

---

## üîÑ Job-Level Env Variables

```yaml
jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job One: ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"
```

‚ùå **Not accessible in other jobs**.

---

## üìç Step-Level Env Variables

```yaml
jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set Channel Env
        env:
          CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro
        run: echo "Hello $CHANNEL_NAME"

      - name: Will Fail
        run: echo "No access to $CHANNEL_NAME"
```

‚úÖ Only **first step** has access to `CHANNEL_NAME`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                                       | Problem                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Using `$CHANNEL_NAME` in YAML (e.g., `name:`) | ‚ùå Not interpreted                               |
| Forgetting scope                              | ‚ùå Step-level envs not accessible in other steps |
| Missing `env.` in workflow expressions        | ‚ùå Use `${{ env.VAR_NAME }}`                     |

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Usage Examples

| Context                    | Correct Usage             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| In `run:` bash             | `echo $CHANNEL_NAME`      |
| In `run:` pwsh             | `echo $env:CHANNEL_NAME`  |
| In `name:` or `id:` fields | `${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}` |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Feature                    | Value                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Define workflow-wide `env` | At the top of the YAML file  |
| Define job-wide `env`      | Inside each job block        |
| Define step-level `env`    | Inside individual step block |
| Access in scripts (bash)   | `$VAR_NAME`                  |
| Access in PowerShell       | `$env:VAR_NAME`              |
| Access in YAML             | `${{ env.VAR_NAME }}`        |

* A full working example workflow
* Export as PDF / Markdown
* Extended example using dynamic inputs and conditional logic
Here are the **structured notes** for the GitHub Actions tutorial on **setting and updating environment variables programmatically**, covering key concepts, syntax, and limitations:

---

## üìò GitHub Actions: Setting Environment Variables Programmatically

---

### ‚úÖ What You Will Learn

* How to **set environment variables dynamically** during workflow execution
* How to **update existing variables**
* How **scope affects visibility** across steps and jobs

---

## üîß Syntax to Set Environment Variables

### üìù Bash Style (in `run:`)

```bash
echo "VAR_NAME=value" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

> ‚úÖ This writes to the special GitHub-provided file `$GITHUB_ENV` which makes `VAR_NAME` available to all subsequent steps in the **same job**.

---

## üìÇ Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Env Programmatic Demo

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro  # Workflow-wide variable

jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set Env Variables Programmatically
        run: echo "COUNT=100000" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Access Env Variables
        run: |
          echo "Count: $COUNT"
          echo "Channel: $CHANNEL_NAME"

      - name: Update Env Variables
        run: |
          echo "CHANNEL_NAME=Test" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "COUNT=200000" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Access Updated Env Variables
        run: |
          echo "Updated Count: $COUNT"
          echo "Updated Channel: $CHANNEL_NAME"
```

---

## üß© Output Behavior

| Step                           | Output                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Access Env Variables`         | `COUNT=100000`<br>`CHANNEL_NAME=interview Pro` |
| `Access Updated Env Variables` | `COUNT=200000`<br>`CHANNEL_NAME=Test`          |

> üîÅ Updated values are **only available in subsequent steps of the same job**.

---

## üß™ Job 2 Behavior Test

```yaml
  job-two:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job-one
    steps:
      - name: Access Env in Job 2
        run: echo "Hello $CHANNEL_NAME"
```

### üîç Result:

* **Output:** `Hello interview Pro`
* Because updates in `job-one` **do not affect other jobs**, even if `CHANNEL_NAME` was changed.

| Scope                   | Values set using `$GITHUB_ENV` are **only available to later steps in the same job** |
| Default Value Overwrite | You can overwrite workflow-level envs using `$GITHUB_ENV`, but only within that job  |
| Reserved Prefix         | Don't use `GITHUB_` prefix for your custom variable names                            |
