Here are the **comprehensive notes** on **Environment Variables in GitHub Actions**, based on the tutorial:

---

## üìò GitHub Actions: Environment Variables

---

### ‚úÖ What are Environment Variables?

* **Key-value pairs** used to store configuration or reusable data.
* Help avoid hardcoding values into workflow scripts.
* Accessible at **workflow**, **job**, or **step** levels.

---

## üîë Scope Levels of Environment Variables

| Level        | Defined Under          | Accessible In                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Workflow** | Top-level `env:`       | All jobs and steps in the workflow |
| **Job**      | Inside a `job > env:`  | All steps within that specific job |
| **Step**     | Inside a `step > env:` | Only that specific step            |

---

## üß± Sample Workflow: `.github/workflows/env-vars.yml`

```yaml
name: Env Vars Demo

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

env:  # üîπ Workflow-level env variable
  CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro

jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Greetings
        run: echo "Hello ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"

      - name: Get Comments
        run: echo "Get comments on ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"
```

---

### üí° Accessing Environment Variables

| Context               | Syntax                       | Example                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Workflow YAML**     | `${{ env.VAR_NAME }}`        | `${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}` |
| **Inside Bash**       | `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` | `echo $CHANNEL_NAME`      |
| **Inside PowerShell** | `$env:VAR_NAME`              | `echo $env:CHANNEL_NAME`  |

---

## üîÅ Using Env Variables in Multiple Jobs

```yaml
env:
  CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro

jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"

  job-two:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello from ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"
```

‚úÖ Workflow-level `env` is accessible across all jobs.

---

## üîÑ Job-Level Env Variables

```yaml
jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job One: ${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}"
```

‚ùå **Not accessible in other jobs**.

---

## üìç Step-Level Env Variables

```yaml
jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set Channel Env
        env:
          CHANNEL_NAME: interview Pro
        run: echo "Hello $CHANNEL_NAME"

      - name: Will Fail
        run: echo "No access to $CHANNEL_NAME"
```

‚úÖ Only **first step** has access to `CHANNEL_NAME`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                                       | Problem                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Using `$CHANNEL_NAME` in YAML (e.g., `name:`) | ‚ùå Not interpreted                               |
| Forgetting scope                              | ‚ùå Step-level envs not accessible in other steps |
| Missing `env.` in workflow expressions        | ‚ùå Use `${{ env.VAR_NAME }}`                     |

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Usage Examples

| Context                    | Correct Usage             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| In `run:` bash             | `echo $CHANNEL_NAME`      |
| In `run:` pwsh             | `echo $env:CHANNEL_NAME`  |
| In `name:` or `id:` fields | `${{ env.CHANNEL_NAME }}` |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Feature                    | Value                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Define workflow-wide `env` | At the top of the YAML file  |
| Define job-wide `env`      | Inside each job block        |
| Define step-level `env`    | Inside individual step block |
| Access in scripts (bash)   | `$VAR_NAME`                  |
| Access in PowerShell       | `$env:VAR_NAME`              |
| Access in YAML             | `${{ env.VAR_NAME }}`        |
