Here are the **structured notes** for the GitHub Actions tutorial on **job-level outputs**, including how to set outputs in one job and access them in another using `needs`.

---

## 📘 GitHub Actions: Job Outputs & Dependencies

---

### ✅ What Are Job Outputs?

* **Job outputs** allow you to **pass data from one job to another**.
* Outputs are set using the `outputs:` block at the **job level** and are accessed in dependent jobs using the `needs` context.

---

## 🧱 Workflow Setup: `.github/workflows/job-output.yml`

```yaml
name: Job Output

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

---

## 🔨 Job 1: Set & Expose Outputs

```yaml
jobs:
  job-one:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      job1_name: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.name }}  # Exposing step output at job level

    steps:
      - name: Set Output
        id: set-output
        run: echo "name=interview Pro" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Access Output in Same Job
        run: echo "Value of name: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.name }}"
```

### 🧠 Notes:

* The **step** sets an output using:

  ```bash
  echo "name=interview Pro" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  ```
* The **job** exposes the output by referencing the step output:

  ```yaml
  outputs:
    job1_name: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.name }}
  ```

---

## 🧩 Job 2: Access Output From Job 1

```yaml
  job-two:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job-one  # Required to access job-one's outputs
    steps:
      - name: Access Job Output
        run: echo "Value of name from Job 1: ${{ needs.job-one.outputs.job1_name }}"
```

### 🔑 Key Concepts:

* `needs:` is **required** to access previous job outputs.
* Use:

  ```yaml
  ${{ needs.<job_id>.outputs.<output_key> }}
  ```

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistake

Trying to access step output in a different job **without exposing it via `outputs:`** and **without `needs:`** will result in **undefined or empty values**.

---

## 🧠 PowerShell Note (if using `pwsh` shell)

To set outputs:

```powershell
"key=value" | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT -Append
```

## ✅ Summary

| Feature                              | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `echo "key=value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT` | Sets output in a step (bash)                 |
| `outputs:` at job level              | Exposes selected step outputs to other jobs  |
| `needs:`                             | Required to access outputs from another job  |
| `needs.<job_id>.outputs.<key>`       | Syntax to reference output from previous job |
| Multiple jobs                        | Can consume same outputs via `needs`         |

---

### 🧪 Example Flow:

1. **Job 1** sets `name = interview Pro` and exposes it via `outputs:`.
2. **Job 2** declares dependency on `job-one` using `needs:`.
3. **Job 2** accesses the output using:

   ```yaml
   ${{ needs.job-one.outputs.job1_name }}
   ```

Let me know if you'd like:

* Full YAML file (copy-paste ready)
* Export as **Markdown**, **PDF**, or a **presentation**
* Examples with **multiple outputs** or **conditional jobs** using these outputs

Happy to generate it!
