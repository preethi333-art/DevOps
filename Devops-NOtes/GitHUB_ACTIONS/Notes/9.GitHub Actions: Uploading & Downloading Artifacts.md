Here are the **detailed and structured notes** for the GitHub Actions tutorial on **uploading and downloading artifacts**, especially in the context of an Angular app CI/CD pipeline.

## 📘 GitHub Actions: Uploading & Downloading Artifacts

---

### ✅ What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts in GitHub Actions:

* Are **files or folders** created during a workflow run
* Can be **uploaded and reused** in other jobs or workflow runs
* Are commonly used to **pass build outputs** (e.g., `dist/`) between jobs like **build → deploy**

---

## 🧱 Workflow Recap

### 🔨 Build & Upload Artifacts

```yaml
name: Build Angular App

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-angular:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build Angular app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-artifact
          path: dist/
```

> 🔁 This builds the Angular app and uploads the `dist/` folder as an artifact named `build-artifact`.

---

### 🚀 Deploy Job (Download Artifact)

```yaml
  deploy-angular:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-angular  # Waits for build to complete
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-artifact
          path: artifact/

      - name: List downloaded files
        run: ls -R artifact
```

---

## 📦 Upload Artifact Action

* **Action**: `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
* **Key inputs**:

  * `name`: Name of the artifact (e.g., `build-artifact`)
  * `path`: Folder or files to upload

---

## 📥 Download Artifact Action

* **Action**: `actions/download-artifact@v4`
* **Key inputs**:

  | Input            | Description                                        |
  | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
  | `name`           | (Optional) Name of the artifact to download        |
  | `path`           | Local directory where artifact will be extracted   |
  | `merge-multiple` | If multiple artifacts exist, merge into one folder |
  | `run-id`         | Download artifact from a **specific workflow run** |
  | `repository`     | Used to download from another repo                 |
  | `token`          | Required for downloading from external repos       |

---

## 🔁 Artifact Lifecycle in Workflow

1. **Build Job**:

   * Compiles app
   * Generates `dist/` folder
   * Uploads as `build-artifact`

2. **Deploy Job**:

   * Depends on `build-angular`
   * Downloads `build-artifact` into `artifact/`
   * You can then deploy or inspect contents

---

## 🧪 Verification Step

You can verify download with:

```yaml
run: ls -R artifact
```

✅ Sample Output:

```
artifact/
└── angular-demo-app/
    ├── index.html
    ├── main.js
    ├── styles.css
    └── ...
```

## ✅ Summary

| Feature            | Action Used                    | Notes                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Upload Artifacts   | `actions/upload-artifact@v4`   | Uploads folders like `dist/`            |
| Download Artifacts | `actions/download-artifact@v4` | Downloads previously uploaded artifacts |
| Dependency         | `needs: build-angular`         | Ensures download waits for upload       |
| Verification       | `ls -R artifact/`              | Confirms contents were downloaded       |
