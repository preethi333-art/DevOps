Here are concise notes summarizing the key points from your detailed explanation of **GitHub Actions**:

## GitHub Actions: Notes from Basics to Advanced

### 1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
- **GitHub Actions** is a built-in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool in GitHub.
- Automates software development workflows (build, test, deploy, etc.).
- Triggered by events like code commits, pull requests, or scheduled times.
- Supports custom and community-contributed actions

### 2. **Core Concepts**
- **Workflow**: Defined in YAML files (`.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml`).
- reserved folder structure name in the GitHub and that's where you're going to write your yaml file with your own file names ending with extension either yaml file or yml 
- **Trigger/Event**: Specifies when the workflow runs (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch` for manual).
- **Job**: A group of steps executed on a runner (can run sequentially or in parallel).
- **Step**: Individual tasks/commands within a job.
- **Action**: Reusable code (from GitHub or community) to perform common tasks (e.g., checkout code, set up AWS credentials).

- Great catch! Here’s a focused note on **events** in GitHub Actions, including the types you mentioned:

---

## GitHub Actions: Events That Trigger Workflows

**Events** are what cause a GitHub Actions workflow to run. There are several types:

### 1. **Webhook Events (Repository Events)**
Triggered by activity in the repository, such as:
- **push**: When code is pushed to the repository.
- **pull_request**: When a pull request is opened, synchronized, or closed.
- **issues**: When an issue is opened, edited, or closed.
- **release**: When a release is published, edited, or deleted.
- **fork**, **star**, **delete**, etc.

### 2. **Scheduled Events**
- Use the `schedule` keyword with a cron expression to run workflows at specific times (e.g., nightly builds).
  ```yaml
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 0 * * *' # every day at midnight UTC
  ```

### 3. **Manual Events**
- Use `workflow_dispatch` to allow users to manually trigger a workflow from the GitHub UI.
  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
  ```

**Summary Table:**

| Event Type         | Example Keyword      | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Webhook/Repo Event | `push`, `pull_request`, `issues` | Triggered by repository activity            |
| Scheduled          | `schedule`          | Triggered at set times via cron             |
| Manual             | `workflow_dispatch` | Triggered manually from the GitHub UI       |



### 3. **Workflow File Structure**
- **name**: Name of the workflow.
- **on**: Event(s) that trigger the workflow.
- **env**: Environment variables for the workflow.
- **permissions**: Permissions for the workflow (important for OIDC/AWS).
- **jobs**: One or more jobs, each with:
  - **runs-on**: The runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, or self-hosted).
  - **steps**: List of steps (actions or shell commands).

### 4. **Runners**
- **GitHub-hosted runners**: Managed by GitHub (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Self-hosted runners**: Managed by you, more control and security.

### 5. **Secrets and Variables**
- **Secrets**: Securely store sensitive data (API keys, credentials). Referenced as `secrets.NAME`.
- **Variables**: Store non-sensitive data, can be repository-wide or environment-specific.
- **Environments**: Define different deployment targets (dev, test, prod), each with its own secrets/variables.

### 6. **Advanced Features**
- **Matrix Builds**: Run jobs across multiple configurations (e.g., different Node.js versions).
- **Caching**: Speed up workflows by caching dependencies or build outputs.
- **Reusable Workflows**: Modularize and reuse workflow logic across repositories.

### 7. **Common Use Cases**
- **CI**: Build and test code on every push/PR.
- **CD**: Deploy code automatically after successful builds.
- **Manual Triggers**: Use `workflow_dispatch` for workflows that need to be run manually.

### 8. **Example Workflow (Simplified)**
```yaml
name: CI Example
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```


Thank you for pointing that out! Here’s a focused note on the **`uses`** keyword in GitHub Actions:

---

## The `uses` Keyword in GitHub Actions

### What is `uses`?

- The **`uses`** keyword is used in a workflow’s steps to call a reusable **action** or another **workflow**.
- It allows you to leverage pre-built or community-contributed actions, or reference your own custom actions.

### Where is it used?

- Inside the `steps` section of a job in your workflow YAML file.

### Syntax

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Set up Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '18'
```

### What can you reference with `uses`?

- **Marketplace Actions:**  
  Example: `actions/checkout@v3`
- **Actions from other repositories:**  
  Example: `owner/repo@ref` (e.g., `my-org/my-action@v1`)
- **Local actions:**  
  Example: `./.github/actions/my-local-action`
- **Reusable workflows:**  
  Example: `.github/workflows/another-workflow.yml@main`

### Why use `uses`?

- To **reuse code** and avoid duplicating logic.
- To **leverage community solutions** for common tasks (e.g., checking out code, setting up languages, uploading artifacts).
- To **modularize** your own automation logic.

**Summary Table:**

| Usage                | Example Syntax                        | Purpose                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Marketplace Action   | `uses: actions/checkout@v3`          | Use official/community action  |
| Repo Action          | `uses: my-org/my-action@v1`           | Use action from another repo   |
| Local Action         | `uses: ./.github/actions/my-action`   | Use action in your repo        |
| Reusable Workflow    | `uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml@main` | Call another workflow         |

---

**Tip:**  
Always specify the version/tag (e.g., `@v3`) for security and stability.




### 9. **Best Practices**
- Store secrets securely, never hardcode them.
- Use environments for deployment separation.
- Modularize workflows for reusability.
- Use caching to speed up builds.
- Use matrix builds for multi-version testing.
