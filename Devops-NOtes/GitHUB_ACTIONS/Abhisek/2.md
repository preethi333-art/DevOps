## 📝 GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runners Notes

### **What are Self-Hosted Runners?**

**GitHub Hosted Runners:**
- ✅ **Free** for public/open source projects
- ❌ **No ownership** - GitHub manages them
- ❌ **Limited resources** and dependencies
- ❌ **Security concerns** for private/enterprise projects

**Self-Hosted Runners:**
- ✅ **Full control** over the environment
- ✅ **Custom resources** (32GB RAM, special packages)
- ✅ **Enhanced security** for private repositories
- ❌ **Requires setup and maintenance**

---

### **When to Use Self-Hosted Runners?**

| **Scenario** | **Use Self-Hosted** |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 🔒 **Private repositories** | ✅ Yes |
| 🏢 **Enterprise/banking apps** | ✅ Yes (security) |
| 💾 **High resource requirements** | ✅ Yes |
| 🔧 **Custom dependencies** | ✅ Yes |
| 🌐 **Public/open source** | ❌ No (use GitHub hosted) |

---

### **Setup Process**

#### **1. EC2 Instance Configuration**
```bash
# Security Group Rules
Inbound:  Port 80 (HTTP), Port 443 (HTTPS)
Outbound: Port 80 (HTTP), Port 443 (HTTPS)
```

#### **2. GitHub Repository Setup**
- Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners**
- Click **"New self-hosted runner"**
- Select OS and architecture
- **Copy the token** (keep it secret!)

#### **3. EC2 Runner Installation**
```bash
# Run these commands on EC2 instance
# (Token provided by GitHub)
./config.sh --url https://github.com/owner/repo --token TOKEN
./run.sh
```

#### **4. Workflow Configuration**
```yaml
name: Self-Hosted Runner Demo
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted  # ← Key change!
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "Running on self-hosted runner"
```

### **Communication Flow**

```
GitHub Repository
       ↓ (HTTP/HTTPS)
   EC2 Instance (Runner)
       ↓ (Job execution)
   Results sent back to GitHub
```

**Important:** Both **inbound** and **outbound** traffic rules are crucial for communication.

### **Interview Questions & Answers**

#### **Q: Why GitHub Actions over Jenkins?**
**A:** 
- **Public projects:** GitHub Actions is free
- **Private projects:** Consider Jenkins for more features/plugins
- **GitHub ecosystem:** If using GitHub extensively (Wiki, Projects, Security)

#### **Q: How to secure sensitive data?**
**A:** Use **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

#### **Q: How to write GitHub Actions?**
**A:** 
- Create `.github/workflows/` folder
- Use YAML syntax with `on`, `jobs`, `steps`
- Example: `on: [push, pull_request]`

### **GitHub Actions vs Jenkins Comparison**

| **Aspect** | **GitHub Actions** | **Jenkins** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Public Projects** | ✅ **Winner** (Free) | ❌ Costs |
| **Private Projects** | ❌ Limited features | ✅ **Winner** (More plugins) |
| **Setup** | ✅ Simple | ❌ Complex |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ None | ❌ Required |
| **Ecosystem** | ✅ GitHub integrated | ❌ Standalone |

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Self-hosted runners** = Your own infrastructure (like Jenkins agents)
2. **Use when:** Private repos, security requirements, custom resources
3. **Setup requires:** EC2 instance + security groups + GitHub token
4. **Communication:** HTTP/HTTPS between GitHub and your runner
5. **Public projects:** Stick with GitHub hosted runners (free)
