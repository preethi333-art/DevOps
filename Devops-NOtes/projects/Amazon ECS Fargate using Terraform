Excited to share a recent project where I set up a fully automated containerized application on Amazon ECS Fargate, focusing on security, automation, and CI/CD pipeline deployment using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:
This project involved setting up an automated containerized application on Amazon ECS Fargate using Terraform, with Docker images pushed to Amazon ECR. I implemented secure private networking, Blue-Green deployments, and encrypted logging via CloudWatch and KMS.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:
 • Leveraged ECS Fargate to remove infrastructure overhead and 
 cut costs with pay-per-use pricing.
 • Configure VPC Interface Endpoints for Amazon ECR and Amazon 
 S3 to ensure all data traffic remains within the AWS network, 
 reducing exposure to the public internet.
 • Build and containerize the application using Docker, and securely 
 push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
 • Deploy the application on Amazon ECS with health checks, enable 
 centralized monitoring via CloudWatch Logs, and secure log data 
 and ECR images using AWS KMS encryption.
 • Enabled OIDC for GitHub Actions to securely access AWS 
 resources, enabling seamless CI/CD integration without long-lived 
 credentials.
 • Orchestrate Blue-Green deployments on ECS Fargate using GitHub 
 Actions and AWS CodeDeploy for seamless traffic shifting.

𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲/𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆:
 • Enhances availability by deploying updates to a separate (green) environment first.
 • Enables safe testing and minimizes rollback risks and downtime.
 • Improves reliability: Blue/Green deployments provide stable updates with built-in safety features.

𝗩𝗣𝗖 𝗘𝗻𝗱𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 - 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁:
 • Used Interface Endpoints for ECR and S3, ensuring that traffic stays within AWS's private network and has no exposure to the public internet. 
 • Enhanced security posture and compliance by keeping all traffic private.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 & 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:
 • VPC endpoints help keep all data within the AWS network, ensuring there’s no exposure to the internet for better security.
 • Blue-Green deployments with CodeDeploy allow automated updates in a safe way, reducing downtime and risks.
 • KMS encryption protects data both while it's stored and during transfer, keeping it secure.
 • Using Infrastructure as Code with Terraform makes setting up and managing infrastructure easier, repeatable, and scalable.
 • CI/CD with GitHub Actions automates the deployment process, improving efficiency and productivity.
 • Amazon ECS Fargate offers serverless containers with pay-per-use pricing, integrated with CloudWatch for performance monitoring and security insights.

This project successfully combined DevOps practices, strong security measures, and AWS-native automation to deliver an efficient solution
