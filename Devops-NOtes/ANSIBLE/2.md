## **Introduction**
- Welcome back, Day 15 of the DevOps course.
- Day 14 was theory: configuration management, Ansible vs. Puppet, etc.
- Today: **Practical Ansible** from scratch.

---

## **1. Setting Up Ansible**
- **Recommendation:** Use a Linux machine (easier for beginners).
- **Install Ansible:**
  - On Ubuntu:  
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ansible
    ```
  - On Mac: `brew install ansible`
  - On Windows: `choco install ansible`
  - Use your OS’s package manager for simplicity.
- **Verify Installation:**  
  `ansible --version`

---

## **2. Passwordless SSH Authentication**
- **Why?** Ansible needs to connect to target servers without a password.
- **Setup:**
  1. On the Ansible server, generate SSH keys:  
     `ssh-keygen`
  2. Copy the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to the target server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
  3. Now, SSH from Ansible server to target server should not prompt for a password.
- **Repeat** for all target servers.

---

## **3. Ansible Inventory File**
- **Purpose:** Lists all target servers for Ansible.
- **Format:**  
  - Each line: IP address or hostname of a target server.
  - Can group servers (e.g., `[webservers]`, `[dbservers]`).
- **Default location:** `/etc/ansible/hosts`
- **Custom location:** You can keep it in your project directory.

---

## **4. Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands**
- **What?** Run simple, one-off tasks without writing a playbook.
- **Syntax:**  
  ```
  ansible -i inventory all -m shell -a "touch devops_class"
  ```
  - `-i inventory`: inventory file location
  - `all`: run on all hosts in inventory
  - `-m shell`: use the shell module
  - `-a`: arguments to the module
- **Examples:**
  - Create a file, check disk space, copy files, etc.
- **Tip:** Use ad-hoc commands for simple tasks; use playbooks for complex/multiple tasks.

---

## **5. Grouping Servers in Inventory**
- **Why?** Run tasks on specific groups (e.g., only web servers).
- **How?**  
  ```
  [webservers]
  172.31.62.100

  [dbservers]
  172.31.62.101
  ```
- **Run on a group:**  
  ```
  ansible -i inventory webservers -m shell -a "uptime"
  ```

---

## **6. Writing Your First Ansible Playbook**
- **When?** Use playbooks for multiple or complex tasks.
- **Format:** YAML file (e.g., `first_playbook.yaml`)
- **Example: Install and start nginx**
  ```yaml
  ---
  - name: Install and start nginx
    hosts: all
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install nginx
        apt:
          name: nginx
          state: present
      - name: Start nginx
        service:
          name: nginx
          state: started
  ```
- **Run the playbook:**  
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i inventory first_playbook.yaml
  ```
- **Verbose/debug:** Add `-v`, `-vv`, or `-vvv` for more output.

---

## **7. Ansible Roles**
- **Why?** For large/complex playbooks (e.g., Kubernetes setup), roles help organize code.
- **Create a role:**  
  ```
  ansible-galaxy role init kubernetes
  ```
- **Role structure:**  
  - `tasks/` – main tasks
  - `handlers/` – error/notification handling
  - `files/` – files to copy
  - `templates/` – Jinja2 templates
  - `vars/`, `defaults/` – variables
  - `meta/` – metadata, licensing
  - `tests/` – test playbooks
  - `README.md` – documentation
- **Use roles in playbooks for modular, maintainable automation.**

---

## **8. Real-World Example**
- **Kubernetes setup:**  
  - Use Terraform to create EC2 instances.
  - Use Ansible roles to configure master and worker nodes.
  - Roles help manage complexity (50+ tasks, variables, secrets, etc.).

---

## **9. Resources & Practice**
- **GitHub repo:** Contains playbook and role examples (e.g., JBoss Standalone).
- **Practice:**  
  - Try ad-hoc commands.
  - Write your own playbooks.
  - Explore and use roles.
- **Interview Questions:**  
  - Difference between ad-hoc and playbook.
  - How to group servers.
  - What are roles and why use them.
  - Ansible modules, handlers, variables, etc.

---

## **10. Closing**
- Practice the examples shown.
- Use verbosity for learning/debugging.
- More examples and interview questions in the GitHub repo and upcoming videos.
