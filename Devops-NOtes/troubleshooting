issues faced in jenkins file
when ever build fails we first see in the console or /var/lib/jenkins/logs
 and we have to analyze the logs why those getting failed, as I worked in
development project it made me easy to differentiate whether the error related to devops or in code 
1.
recently we faced 1 issue developer worked on a bug fix and pushed the changes I got error some variable not set like that there
is something called application.yml they only changed 
in local but forgot to add in app-dev.yml and other so I asked dev to fix those errors

DOCKER
when creating image its not creating its not ending
---> verify base image
----> always try to use alpine image (might be heavy, might not be official)
----> try to use from cache if something already there 

sometimes docker container stops running it is not active
docker logs
docker stats
any cpu/ network issue 

crashloopback(pod is coming up but it is not able to comeup)--> out of memory issue, not able to connect properly
scenario--> database connection issue that pod not able to connect with database

IMAGE PULL BACK--> image we given is not correct, might be image in private registry, token may not be correct
verify tag name
