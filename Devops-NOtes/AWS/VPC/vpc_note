IN AWS we have 2 types of services
AWS managed services-->(SAAS) managed by AWS ex: s3
customer Managed services --> (IAAS,PAAS) --> customer managed services are all in VPC

IN VPC there are 2 types of subnet:
1. public subnet--> anyone can access--> has internet connection
2. private subnet--> no internet connection
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet gateway : allows communication between your VPC and the internet--> 2 way 
if private subnet want to install anything from internet we have NAT GATEWAY
NAT GATEWAY for Private subnet: created in public subnet --> allows internet only outgoing
              connect route tables to NAT GATEWAy



              It looks like the structure you shared has formatting issues, and I can clarify and adjust it for a clean representation. Here's a corrected version of the diagram:

### Key Components:
1. **Public Subnet**:
   - Instances in the public subnet use a **Public Route Table**.
   - Public Route Table points `0.0.0.0/0` to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for external access.

2. **Private Subnets**:
   - Instances in private subnets are connected via a **Private Route Table**.
   - Private Route Table points `0.0.0.0/0` to the **NAT Gateway** for outbound internet access.

3. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
   - Allows public internet access to instances in the **Public Subnet**.

4. **NAT Gateway**:
   - Allows instances in **Private Subnets** to access the internet without exposing them to inbound connections.

5. **Route Tables**:
   - **Public Route Table**: Routes to the IGW for public subnets.
   - **Private Route Table**: Routes to the NAT Gateway for private subnets.

Security group/NACL

NAT GATEWAY MASK

security group at ec2 level
inbound traffic deny all by default
outbount traffic allow any where by default except 25 beczuse 25 is the mailing service
AWS doesnot want to record the ip of ec2 where it is hosted

NACL add additional layer of security--> at subnet level  Deny+ allow
100 --> allow all
*   --> deny all * is the least priority

least rule number highest priority   


Securitu group vs NACL                  

1.Assigned To The Instance.
2.Simultaneously Applies All Rule
3.You Can Set Only Allow Rules
4.Stateful

1.Assigned To Subnet
2.Rules Applies In Sequence
3.You Can Set Allow and Deny Rules
4.Stateless

stateful--> when ever we send request from our ec2 to outside we need to enable outbount in ec2
also if outside server want to send req to our ec2 we have to enable inbound traffic
if ec2 initiate the connection to the outside server then no need to enable in inbound traffic it
automatically identify the serverthat is stateful
stateless--> 
eventhough ec2 initiate the connection to the outside server then we need to enable that in inbound traffic it wont identify
automatically that is stateful
