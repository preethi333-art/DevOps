 What is Elastic Load Balancer[It overcome the loads on server to increase the server capacity]
-> Elastic load Balancer automatically divert the incoming traffic into multiple targets.
It automatically scales and balances the load to ensure high avaliablity and fault tolerance for application

# Types of Load Balancer
1) Classic Load Balancer
2) Application Load Balancer
3) Network Load Balancer
4) Gateway Load Balancer

Classic Load Balancer
It is a Old version
Aws is not recommand because it cost is very high

Application Load Balancer
It advance version of Classic load balancer
It support the port mapping (related to http and https)

Network Load Balancer
It will work as transport layer
It will work main on TCP and UDP protocols
TCP [Transmission control protocol]
UDP [User dataground protocol]

Gateway Load Balancer
It is used for security Purpose

# How to create the Load Balancer
-> First we will create two instances and connect two instances with mobaxstream
-> you will install below commands in both instances
	sudo yum update
	sudo yum install httpd -y
	sudo service httpd start
	sudo service httpd enable
	sudo service httpd status
	cd /var/www/html/
	sudo vi index.html
-> We will write something differently in both instances
-> After that you will browser your Ip and along with 80 port to both instances
-> Before we create load balancer we will create target-group
-> Go to target-group and create the target group and add your instances in target group
-> After create target-group and go to load balancer and create load balancer with that target group
-> After create load balancer then you will take load balancer DNS URL and paste the browser

& layers of OSI model

user want to access linkedin.com/preethi

ur request from user is travelling 7 diff layers 

user  (internally)
  |                                                                           
7.Application layer(http/https) --> decide what kind of protocol used to talk to server http/sftp/ftp we wont specify in browser, it will do automation uses http  
no nned to specify explicitly

6.Presentation layer(encryption and decryption) --> should this request secure or its okay to send insecure request take care of encrypting your request using SSL/TLS algorithm

5.session layer(create a session object)--> what kind of client requested when created

4.transport layer(request segregated into smaller chunks)--> split in to small chunks, and chexks flows any errors sever easily read
3.network layer(routers) --> your req goes to multiple routers--used for logical addressing
2.Datalink layer(switch) --> we have all switches --used for physical addressing
1.physical layer(cable) --> all cables connected to server

The ELB distributes incoming traffic to the Listener.
The Listener routes the traffic to the appropriate Target Groups based on the rules you define.
Each Target Group contains multiple Instances (or IP addresses) that handle the traffic.


when ALB
if you want to intercept user request at layer7 and routing traffic based on host
   path
   domain
intercept http request-->read req means what are headers or path and route based on path or host ex amazon.com/.in

but costly because it has advance capabilities it intercept and decide which server 


network LB acts on layer 4  _--> less costly no latency
NO PATH/HOST/DOMAIn BASED ROUTING
works Based on IPs and ports
mainly used in steaming platform
perform routing on tcp and uDp

intercept at L4 depending on port and IP forward reques
