=========================
What is Infrastructure ?
=========================

=> The resources required to run our company / Project

 Ex: Machines, Network, Storage, Database, Monitoring etc...

=> We can maintain infrastructure in 2 ways

				1) On-Prem infrastructure

				2) Cloud Infrastrcture

==================================
What is On-Prem Infrastructure ?
==================================				

=> On-Prem means we need to purchase and we need to maintain our resources

=> We have several challenges with On-Prem infrastructure

				- Lot of cost
				- Scalability issue
				- Availability issue
				- Security issue
				- Network issues etc...

=> To overcome the problems of on-prem infrastructure companies are preferring Cloud Infrastructure.

==========================
What is Cloud Computing?
===========================

=> The process of delivering IT resources over the internet on-demand basis with "Pay As You Go" Model is called as Cloud Computing.

=> We have below advantages with Cloud Computing....

				- Pay as you go
				- Less Cost
				- Scalability
				- Availability
				- Security
				- Backup etc...
================
Cloud Providers
================

1) Amazon => AWS

2) Microsoft => Azure

3) Google => GCP

4) Salesforce

5) Ali Baba.....

======================
Cloud Service Models
======================

=> We have 3 types of cloud service models

1) IAAS : Infrastructure as a service

2) PAAS : Platform as a service

3) SAAS : Software as a service


=================
What is SaaS
=================

-> Software as a service

-> Cloud Provider will give their application to run our business

	Ex: Zoom, Google Drive, Dropbox, 

-> Application + Infrastructure + Platform - will be maintained by provider.

=============
What is PaaS
=============

-> Platform as a Service

-> Provider will give ready made platform to run our application

-> We need to take care of our application, provider will take care of infrastructure and platform.

	Ex: AWS Elastic Beanstack

==============
What is IaaS
==============

-> Infrastructure as a Service

-> Provider will give only infrastructure
	
	Ex: machines, network, storage...

-> We need to take care of platform and application




===========
AWS Cloud
==========

=> AWS stands for Amazon webservices

=> AWS providing cloud services from 2006 onwards

=> 190+ countries using AWS cloud services to run their businesses

=> AWS works based on Pay as you go model......

=> AWS having global infrastructure

			- Regions (33)

			- Availability Zones (105)

=> Region means geographical location (33 regions)

=> AZ means Data Center (Server Room)

Note: In One Region multiple AZs will be there

			India => Mumbai + Hyd

			=> Mumbai having 3 AZ (2016)
			=> Hyd having 3 AZ (2022)

Note: Its always recommended to select nearest Region to create infrastructure.

Note: We are using AWS free tier account (some services are free.)

Note: If we use any paid service then bill be generated. AWS will not deduct bill amount from our card.

=> AWS will send reminders for bill payment. If we don't pay bill then our AWS account will suspended.

Note: We can request AWS support team to make bill amount as zero for 1 or 2 times.

===============
AWS Services
===============

=> We have 200+ Services.....


1) EC2  : To Create Virtual Machines (Hourly Basis)

2) EBS  : Storage (Hard Disc, SSD) ( 16 TB )

3) Load Balancer : To distribute load

4) Auto Scaling : Adjust capacity based on demand

5) S3 : Unlimited Storage (files)

6) RDS : Relational Database Service

10) Cloud Formation : Infrastructure as a code => Terraform

11) AWS CLI : Command Line Interface

12) Elastic Beanstack : Platform as a service
