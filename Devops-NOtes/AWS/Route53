Route53 provide DNS as a service
Dns resolves domain name to an ip address

why we use DNS
1.ip address difficult to remember
2.ip adress can change any time

1. DNS keeps lot of records that basically  maps your domain name (DNS) to the ip adress
AWS says I will provide DNS as a service
because havong DNS is complex we have to 
buy a domain--> hosting solution --> DNS record

request from user--> route53 --> load balancer--> ec2

1. Domain regestration--> purchase ur domain   from aws or outside
2. hosted zones  --> in HS we create DNS records
domain name --> ip adress like this we have in hosted zones

route53 also performs health checks on the webservers
