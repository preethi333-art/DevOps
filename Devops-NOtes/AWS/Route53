Route53 provide DNS as a service
Dns resolves domain name to an ip address

why we use DNS
1.ip address difficult to remember
2.ip adress can change any time

1. DNS keeps lot of records that basically  maps your domain name (DNS) to the ip adress
AWS says I will provide DNS as a service
because havong DNS is complex we have to 
buy a domain--> hosting solution --> DNS record

request from user--> route53 --> load balancer--> ec2

1. Domain regestration--> purchase ur domain   from aws or outside
2. hosted zones  --> in HS we create DNS records
domain name --> ip adress like this we have in hosted zones

route53 also performs health checks on the webservers


âœ… What is a CNAME Record?
A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is a type of DNS record used to alias one domain name to another.

ðŸ§  Example:
www.example.com â†’ example.com
So when someone visits www.example.com, the browser looks up example.com instead.

âœ… What is an A Record?
An A (Address) record maps a domain name directly to an IPv4 address.

ðŸ§  Example:

example.com â†’ 192.0.2.1
So if your server or load balancer has a public IP, the A record helps route traffic directly there.

âœ… Difference Between A and CNAME:
Feature	A Record	CNAME Record
Points to	IPv4 address	Another domain name
Common Use	Root domain (like example.com)	Subdomain redirection (like www.example.com)
Allowed On	Root domains and subdomains	Only subdomains (not root domains)
DNS Chain	Direct	Indirect (goes through the target)
