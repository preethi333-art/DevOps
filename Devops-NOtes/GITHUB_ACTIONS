## GitHub Actions: Notes from Basics to Advanced

### 1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
- **GitHub Actions** is a built-in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool in GitHub.
- Automates software development workflows (build, test, deploy, etc.).
- Triggered by events like code commits, pull requests, or scheduled times.

### 2. **Core Concepts**
- **Workflow**: Defined in YAML files (`.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml`).
- **Trigger/Event**: Specifies when the workflow runs (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch` for manual).
- **Job**: A group of steps executed on a runner (can run sequentially or in parallel).
- **Step**: Individual tasks/commands within a job.
- **Action**: Reusable code (from GitHub or community) to perform common tasks (e.g., checkout code, set up AWS credentials).

### 3. **Workflow File Structure**
- **name**: Name of the workflow.
- **on**: Event(s) that trigger the workflow.
- **env**: Environment variables for the workflow.
- **permissions**: Permissions for the workflow (important for OIDC/AWS).
- **jobs**: One or more jobs, each with:
  - **runs-on**: The runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, or self-hosted).
  - **steps**: List of steps (actions or shell commands).

### 4. **Runners**
- **GitHub-hosted runners**: Managed by GitHub (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Self-hosted runners**: Managed by you, more control and security.

### 5. **Secrets and Variables**
- **Secrets**: Securely store sensitive data (API keys, credentials). Referenced as `secrets.NAME`.
- **Variables**: Store non-sensitive data, can be repository-wide or environment-specific.
- **Environments**: Define different deployment targets (dev, test, prod), each with its own secrets/variables.

### 6. **Advanced Features**
- **Matrix Builds**: Run jobs across multiple configurations (e.g., different Node.js versions).
- **Caching**: Speed up workflows by caching dependencies or build outputs.
- **Reusable Workflows**: Modularize and reuse workflow logic across repositories.

### 7. **Common Use Cases**
- **CI**: Build and test code on every push/PR.
- **CD**: Deploy code automatically after successful builds.
- **Manual Triggers**: Use `workflow_dispatch` for workflows that need to be run manually.

### 8. **Example Workflow (Simplified)**
```yaml
name: CI Example
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

### 9. **Best Practices**
- Store secrets securely, never hardcode them.
- Use environments for deployment separation.
- Modularize workflows for reusability.
- Use caching to speed up builds.
- Use matrix builds for multi-version testing.
