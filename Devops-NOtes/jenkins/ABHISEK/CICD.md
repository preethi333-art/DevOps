## **Introduction**
- Day 18: CI/CD (most requested topic).
- Will cover: What is CI/CD, key steps, tools (legacy and modern), real-world examples, and how modern organizations implement CI/CD.

---

## **1. What is CI/CD?**
- **CI/CD = Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery**
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
  Automating the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and ensuring code quality before delivery.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):**  
  Automating the deployment of applications to production or other environments so customers can access the latest version quickly and reliably.

---

## **2. Why CI/CD?**
- Ensures code is always tested, secure, and ready for deployment.
- Reduces manual work, speeds up delivery, and increases reliability.
- Essential for modern software development (weeks/days instead of months).

---

## **3. Typical CI/CD Steps**
1. **Unit Testing:**  
   Test individual functions or components (e.g., test addition function in a calculator app).
2. **Static Code Analysis:**  
   Check code for syntax, formatting, unused variables, etc.
3. **Code Quality & Vulnerability Testing:**  
   Scan for security issues and code quality problems.
4. **Automation/Functional Testing:**  
   End-to-end tests to ensure new changes don’t break existing features.
5. **Reporting:**  
   Generate and store reports (test coverage, code quality, etc.).
6. **Deployment:**  
   Deploy the application to a platform where customers can access it.

---

## **4. How CI/CD Works in Practice**
- Developers push code to a Version Control System (VCS) like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- Each commit or pull request triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
- The pipeline automates all the steps above, ensuring every change is tested and ready for deployment.

---

## **5. Legacy CI/CD: Jenkins**
- **Jenkins:**  
  - Acts as an orchestrator for CI/CD.
  - Watches for changes in the VCS (e.g., GitHub).
  - Runs pipelines (series of automated steps).
  - Integrates with tools like Maven (build/test), SonarQube (code quality), ALM (reporting), Kubernetes/Docker (deployment).
- **Jenkins Pipelines:**  
  - Automate the entire process from code commit to deployment.
  - Can promote code through multiple environments (Dev → Staging → Production).
- **Challenges with Jenkins:**  
  - Scaling is hard (requires many VMs for many teams).
  - Costly and complex to maintain at scale.
  - Not ideal for highly dynamic, microservices-based organizations.

---

## **6. Modern CI/CD: Cloud-Native & Event-Driven**
- **Modern tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
- **Example: Kubernetes Project**
  - Uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
  - Event-driven: Only spins up compute resources (containers/pods) when there’s a code change.
  - Shared runners: Resources are shared across projects, reducing waste.
  - Scalable: Can handle thousands of contributors and repositories efficiently.
  - Zero compute waste when idle (no code changes = no running servers).
- **Advantages over Jenkins:**
  - Event-driven by default.
  - Scales up/down automatically.
  - No need to manage VMs for idle time.
  - Integrates easily with cloud and container platforms.

---

## **7. CI/CD Environments**
- **Dev:**  
  - First stop for new code, basic testing.
- **Staging:**  
  - More production-like, for thorough testing.
- **Production:**  
  - Live environment for customers.
- **Promotion:**  
  - Pipelines can automatically or manually promote code from Dev → Staging → Production.

---

## **8. Key CI/CD Tools**
- **Jenkins:** Legacy, still widely used, but not cloud-native.
- **GitHub Actions:** Modern, event-driven, integrates with GitHub.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Similar to GitHub Actions, integrated with GitLab.
- **Travis CI, CircleCI:** Other popular cloud-based CI/CD tools.

---

## **9. Best Practices & Trends**
- Use event-driven, cloud-native CI/CD tools for scalability and efficiency.
- Prefer shared runners/containers over dedicated VMs for cost savings.
- Automate as much as possible for speed and reliability.
- Use pipelines to promote code through multiple environments.
- Store all code and pipeline definitions in version control.
